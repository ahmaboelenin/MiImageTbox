## Project Setup
___
### Install Python 3.x
Mi Image Toolbox requires that you have Python 3.x installed. 
You can download Python from its [Official Site][1]

- I recommend using [PyCharm IDE][2] because it's very simple.

### Download Source Code
* Downloading a zip file

Download MiImageTbox v0.2.zip From This Folder.

* Downloading each file separately

From This Folder choose to download file by file but be careful with "**img**" folder because it contains 
"**icon.png**" that it Will Make The App Crashes if It is not available in "**main.py**" path folder. Or just remove "**Icon line**" from "**main.py**"

### Get The Required Packages
* Use pip to install the required files: 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Enter this commands in "**Python Terminal**": 

`pip install opencv-python`,    
`pip install matplotlib`,   
`pip install numpy`,    
`pip install Pillow`,   
`pip install scipy`
